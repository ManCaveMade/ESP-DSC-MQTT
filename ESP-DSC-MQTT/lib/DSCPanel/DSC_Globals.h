 * uint16_t that should be at least 100 entries as defined by this default below.
 * However some IR sequences will require longer buffers especially those used for
 * air conditioner controls. In general we recommend you keep this value below 255
 * so that the index into the array can remain 8 bits. This library can handle larger 
 * arrays however it will make your code longer in addition to taking more RAM.
